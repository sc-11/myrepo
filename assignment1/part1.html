      <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one,   in the following sections.</p>
      
      <h2>Starting dates</h2>
      
      <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
      
      <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com"> important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
